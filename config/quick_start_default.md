Welcome to MineContext!

MineContext is your Context-Aware AI Partner
Not a workbench, not a second brain, nor a knowledge base—but a truly proactive partner!

Based on Context-Engineering, we are dedicated to helping you work, study, and create better by collecting, processing, and utilizing your context.

## Screen Monitor

Screen Monitor captures anything on your screen and transforms it into intelligent, connected Contexts. All data stays local with full privacy protection！

After enabling Recording, MineContext will periodically capture screenshots for analysis (the interval time can be adjusted in Settings), summarizing your activity every 15 minutes.

You can view previous activities by switching the date.

## Home

Home is where MineContext proactively delivers your daily summaries, todos, tips and other insights—emerging from all your collected Contexts.

### Todo

MineContext will automatically generate todos based on your context. You can delete or edit them.

### Tip

MineContext generates tips to help you uncover insights behind the context.

### Summary

MineContext generates a daily/weekly summary every day at 8 PM and every Sunday at 8 PM, allowing you to review your activities more clearly.

## Creation

You can create with AI enhancement based on your own Context. More importantly, your creations become key parts of the context, with each output serving as future material.
