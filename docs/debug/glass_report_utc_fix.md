# Glass CLI Smoke Report Blank Output - Debug Log

## Context
- Timeline: `uv run glass/scripts/glass_cli_smoke_test.py` on 2025-10-29.
- Symptom: `/persist/glass_cli_smoke/.../glass_report.md` rendered section titles but no substantive activity content.
- Observed artifacts: frame extraction succeeded, speech transcript persisted, but CLI reported contexts missing (`Processed context %s (%s) not found for timeline %s`).

## Diagnostic Timeline
1. **Reproduced storage state**  
   - Verified `glass_multimodal_context` held 828 rows.  
   - Noted two anomalies: mismatched `context_type` for frame/audio rows and repeated “Processed context … not found” warnings on log replay.

2. **Vector store inspection**  
   - Loaded `ProcessedContext` records through `GlassContextSource`; confirmed 826 contexts available and their timestamps around `2025-10-29T10:19:00Z` (UTC).

3. **Report generator analysis**  
   - `_format_timestamp` used naive `datetime.fromtimestamp`, yielding local-time strings like `2025-10-29 18:20:17`.  
   - Prompt compared those local times with UTC context timestamps (`2025-10-29T10:19:00+00:00`), leading the LLM to conclude “no records in range”.

4. **Repository alignment issue**  
   - `GlassContextRepository.upsert_aligned_segments` relied on `zip(items, upserted_ids)`.  
   - ChromaDB batches return IDs grouped per collection (context type), scrambling item↔ID association and causing occasional retrieval failures.

## Fix Summary
- Normalized timestamps to UTC (`...Z`) inside `_format_timestamp`, matching stored context strings.
- Reworked `upsert_aligned_segments` to batch per `context_type`, track original indices, and emit aligned ID lists regardless of backend ordering.

## Verification
- `uv run pytest glass/tests/storage/test_context_repository.py glass/tests/consumption/test_report_generation.py -q`
- Manual rerun of smoke script confirmed populated report content and absence of misalignment warnings.
